# Momentum-Spillover-Effects-GNNs

**Project Title:**  Enhancing Stock Prediction by Modeling Momentum Spillover Effects with a Market Knowledge Graph

**Project Description:** This project explores the limitations of traditional stock prediction methods (technical and fundamental analysis) and proposes a novel approach that leverages relationships between companies to improve forecasting accuracy.

**My Approach:**

 - Recognized momentum spillover: Acknowledged the impact of interconnectedness between companies on stock price movements.
 - Built a Market Knowledge Graph (MKG): Created a knowledge graph to represent relationships between companies and executives.
 - Utilized advanced graph techniques: Employed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture complex interactions and momentum spillover signals within the MKG.

**Key Innovations:**

 - Integrated relational data: Went beyond analyzing individual stocks by incorporating supply chain links, industry affiliations, and executive relationships.
 - Captured hidden connections: Uncovered indirect influences and momentum spillover channels through executives holding positions in multiple companies.
 - Improved prediction accuracy: Demonstrated the potential of relationship-based modeling to enhance stock trend forecasting.

**Impact:** This project offers a new perspective on stock market analysis by highlighting the importance of relationships. It provides a framework for building more sophisticated prediction models that can better capture the complexities of the modern financial world, potentially leading to more informed investment decisions and improved risk management.
